    <ul>This project should be abe to perfrom all CRUD operations using node,express, mongoDB and mongoose</ul>
    <ul>It should also be able to handle dynamic parameters.</ul>
  </li>
</p>

## Installations

```sh
npm install express nodemon mongoose 
```

## Run tests

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Usage
After installing all dependencies, we initiallly set up the server on a localhost usinga port to ensure it's live and running by importing express in the server.js file
```sh
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
```
Then I set up the port to listen on the localhost
```sh
const port = process.env.PORT || 8000
app.listen(port, ()=>{
  `Server is listening on port ${port}`
})
```
I connected to MongoDB using Mongoose through the MongoURI gotten directly from MongoDB and set the code to return errors if it there's a problem and to send an okay message if it connects.
Then I used the Schema and Model to set up how my documents should be returned before proceeding to stating my routes.

for all for operations I used:
```sh
app.get() to fetch documents fro the database
app.post() to add documents to the database
app.put() to updaate documents in the database
app.delete() to remove any documents from the database
```
all operations can be performed by sending a request to fetch a user with an id auto-generated by MongoDB


## Credits
I'm still a bit new to all this so I had lots of help from Youtube and google bfore putting it all together.
